# ISSUE 294

Different results of recurrent GRU network during different executions [Issue 294](https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl/issues/294)

Here you can find C++ and Python code used to check the issue.
We were not able to reproduce the behaviour reported.
The files [report-cpp.log](report-cpp.log) and [report-python.log](report-python.log)
contain the result of different runs with the C++ and Python code.

*C++* version was checked with the develop branch at 2020-07-01.
*Python* version was checked with _pyeddl_ and _eddl_ version 1.0


This folder also contains:

- [here](data) the sample data provided by Wings to help us solve [*Issue 294*](https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl/issues/294),

- [here](python) a sample Python code with the same basic topology tested with _TensorFlow+Keras_ and to extract the sample data to the binary tensor format of the *EDDL*, and 

- [here](scripts) some useful scripts to run the compile C++ code.
